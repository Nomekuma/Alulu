## App Documentation: Alulu - Search Filter Android App

### Overview
This documentation outlines the requirements and features for the Alulu app, a search filter Android app. The app will allow users to filter and search information in an Excel-like format. It will have three sections for managing fittings: Alucobon, Aluminium Profile, and No Stock. The app will provide the ability to add, edit, and store information locally without relying on cloud services.

### Features

1. Search Filter Functionality:
   - Users can search and filter data within each section (Alucobon, Aluminium Profile, No Stock).
   - Filter options include text-based search, category-based filtering, and sorting by specific columns.

2. Three Sections:
   - Alucobon: Allows users to add, edit, and manage information related to Alucobon fittings.
   - Aluminium Profile: Provides functionality to add, edit, and manage information related to Aluminium Profile fittings.
   - No Stock: Enables users to add, edit, and manage information about fittings that are out of stock.

3. Notification for No Stock Items:
   - The app will include a notification system to alert users when a fitting in the "No Stock" section is added or modified.

4. Editable Fields:
   - All fields in each section (Alucobon, Aluminium Profile, No Stock) should be editable to allow easy updates and modifications.

5. Local Storage:
   - The app will save data locally on the device, without relying on cloud services.
   - Users can access and modify their data offline.

6. Export and Import Functionality:
   - Users can export the data to a local file (e.g., CSV or Excel format) for backup or sharing purposes.
   - The app will provide an import feature to allow users to restore or import data from a local file.

### Technical Requirements

- User Interface: Intuitive and user-friendly design with a focus on usability and efficiency.

### Additional Notes

- It should support multiple languages if possible.
- Proper error handling and validation should be implemented throughout the app.
